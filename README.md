## Code contribution

## Setup

### Using python.

Make sure that you have +python3.8 installed.

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

For sure you will get some errors after running above step fix those and then continue.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py makemigrations attendance
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

After that you can load dummy data. Run below command in a different shell.
```bash
python manage.py loaddata ./fixture.json
```

### Lint & Formatting
We use `flake8==6.1.0` as a linter and `black==23.11.0` as a code formatter

Install
```bash
pip install flake8==6.1.0 black==23.11.0
```

Run black
